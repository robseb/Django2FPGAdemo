# Demonstration how to build with the Django Framework a Management Web interface to interact with the FPGA fabric and change the FPGA configuration


 ![Alt text](pic/pic00.jpg?raw=true "Concept")


**This step by step guide shows how to log Sensor Data from a Soft-IP ADC interface within a SQLite-Database and how to plot these data on a web interface. In addition, it is demonstrated how to manage and change the FPGA Configuration with just a web browser.**

Complex web interfaces for controlling and monitoring on embedded systems are standard today. Especially for low quantity FPGA applications, the development of these web applications is often time-consuming. To accelerate this process, it is important to use powerful web development frameworks with simple to use IDEs such as Django. A huge community on desktop site uses that and if the same version of Django runs on the embedded Linux, it is possible to benefit from their knowledge. Django has a comprehensive documentation with many demos. However, these demos are for typical Desktop- and Cloud- applications and not for embedded ones. The important part of embedded management web applications is the interaction between the web interface and Sensor- or FPGA-data.

To demonstrate this, the ADC converter (*Analog Devices LTC2308*) of a *Terasic DE10-Nano*- or *DE10-Standard* Board (Intel Cyclon V SoC-FPGA) with a Soft-IP interface is connected via the *Lightweight HPS to FPGA Bridge* to the Hard Processor System (HPS). 
On the ARM Cortex-A9 of the HPS my embedded Linux, called [*rsYocto*](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto), customized for Intel SoC-FPGA is running.

On *rsYocto* the **Django Framework  (Version 3.0.2)** with all necessary components, like the **Apache Webserver** and the **SQLite database**, is pre-installed. 

**This approach is the monitoring and management of embedded FPGA systems with a web interface**. This cannot be consider for low latency real-time applications. 
The advantage of the usage of SQLite and HTTP with Linux is that these are standard in the desktop world. It allows for example to connect the data with a cloud service by adding a few extensions.

### Reading a Sensor Value with the Django web framework - Sequence Diagram

The following sequence Diagram shows all involved actors and the data flow by reading an ADC Value to a *SQLite* Database. If an user opens the web page, Django plots the complete data into the web interface as shown below. 
![Alt text](pic/SequenceDiagram.jpg?raw=true "Sequence Diagramm of the Sensor Reading")

A HTTP GET-command (here by calling the URL *http://127.0.1:8181/ADCtrigger*) triggers the Django web application. It calls the “*read Sensor*” application. This is a python script, which reads the Soft-IP ADC Interface and returns the ADC convention. Then Django adds the value with a time stamp to the *SQLite* database. 

To repeat and time sync the readout of the ADC a Shell script or the tool `crontab` can be considered.

In case an user is going to open the web application, Django loads the complete data of the ADC from the database and plots them graphically into the webpage.  
This is one part of the final application. The interface for managing FPGA Configurations works similarly.

# Creating a new Django Project on the SoC-FPGA

* Use the Linux Terminal, which is reachable inside *Visual Studio Code Insider* to create a new Django project with the name "DjangoFPGA" by executing the following command:
  ````bash
  django-admin startproject DjangoFPGA
  ````
  ![Alt text](pic/pic01.jpg?raw=true "Django Development with Visual Studio Code")
 
 * **Note:** Use in the drop-down menu (blue arrow) the point "*sh*" to access the Linux Terminal. In case the point is not there, press the “**+**”-icon to add it. 
 * Navigate with the Linux Terminal inside Visual Studio code to this project
   ````bash
   cd DjangoFPGA
   ````
 
## Testing the empty Django Project by accessing it with a web browser

* By default the Django web server is only reachable internally by the embedded Linux
* To access Django applications within your network do the following steps:
  1. Open the Django project settings file (*settings.py*) with *Visual Studio Code* (as shown above) and allow everybody to connect with the following lines:
      ````python
      ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
       '*'
     ]
     ````
  2. After some change of the settings file a **migration** of the project is necessary:
      ````bash
      python3 manage.py migrate 
      ````
    * The output of this command should look like this:
      ````bash
      root@cyclone5:~/DjangoFPGA# python3 manage.py migrate
      Operations to perform:
      Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions

      Applying auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions... OK
      Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
      ````
  3. Use the next command to **start the web server** (here on Port 8181)
      ````bash
      python3 manage.py runserver 0:8181
      ````
    * The output of this command should look like this:
      ````bash
      root@cyclone5:~/DjangoFPGA# python3 manage.py runserver 0:8181
      Watching for file changes with StatReloader
      Performing system checks...

      System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

      Starting development server at http://0:8181/
      Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
      ````
    * **Note:** The default port 8080 is used by the *Apache web server*
  
* Go with a web browser on a device inside this network (computer, tablet, smart-phone) to the URL:
     ````txt
      http://<iPv4-Address of the Board>:8181/ 
     ````
* If you see a *rocket lunch* your Django project works properly

* All **HTTP**-attaches are listed on the terminal as well


# Creating a new Django App to interact with the FPGA fabric
Every Django project requires at least one application (App). We will build an App to readout the Soft-IP ADC Interface (*Analog Devices LTC2308*) of a Terasic DE10-Standard- or Terasic DE10-Nano-Board and present the data in the web browser.
As a second feature, we will build a management interface for changing the FPGA configuration. 

*  The following command adds a new app called "*BoardInteraction*" to the project.
   ````bash
   python3 manage.py startapp BoardInteraction
   ````
  * **Note:** Be sure that this command is executed inside the project-folder (*DjangoFPGA/*)
* The project folder contains the following structure now:
  * All important files are marked
  
  ![Alt text](pic/pic03.jpg?raw=true "Django Folder structure")
  
* Add this application to the Django project by adding the following line to the variable **INSTALLED_APPS** iniside  *settings.py*:
  ````python
  # Application definition
  INSTALLED_APPS = [
      'BoardInteraction.apps.BoardinteractionConfig', # Add this line 
      'django.contrib.admin',
      'django.contrib.auth',
      'django.contrib.contenttypes',
      'django.contrib.sessions',
      'django.contrib.messages',
      'django.contrib.staticfiles',
  ]
  ````
  * **Note:** This is a connection to the *main-function* *BoardinteractionConfig()* that is located in the *"app.py"* file
  * **Migrate** the project again
   ````bash
   python3 manage.py migrate 
   ````

## Creating a model to store the Sensor data and FPGA configuration files into a SQLite database
* Add the following python code to the model file (*DjangoFPGA/BoardInteraction/models.py*)
  ````python
  '''
  Django FPGA Interaction demo application - "models.py"
  '''
  from django.db import models
  from datetime import datetime
   #
   # Class for reading an analog Sensor 
   #
   class ADCSensorReading(models.Model):
       # Sensor value as Char Text Field type   
       reading = models.FloatField()         
       timestamp = models.DateTimeField(default=datetime.now, db_index=True)    # Time stamp

       def __unicode__(self):
           return self.reading

   # 
   # Class for connecting an Analog Devices LTC LTC2308 ADC Channel
   #
   class ADCchannel(models.Model):
       name     = models.CharField(max_length=200)          # a name for the Sensor on the ADC Channel
       slug     = models.SlugField(unique=True)             # an unique working handler name
       readings = models.ManyToManyField(ADCSensorReading)  # the sensor data object
       ch       = models.IntegerField() # the used ADC Channel Number

       def __unicode__(self):
           return self.name

   # 
   # FPGA .rbf Configuration File Database
   # 
   class FPGAconfFiles(models.Model):
       docfile = models.FileField(upload_to='FPGAconfigDatabase/%Y/%m/%d')      # local storge folder  
       timestamp = models.DateTimeField(default=datetime.now, db_index=True)    # Time stamp
  ````
 
 ## Creating an Administrator page to allow an access to the database
 * Create an user who can do the login to the admin site. Run the following command:
    ````bash
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ````
 * Enter an Username, an Email-Address and a Passwort
    ````bash
    Password: **********
    Password (again): *********
    Superuser created successfully.
    ````
 * Allow the Admin to access all database models by adding the following code lines to the Admin-file (*DjangoFPGA/BoardInteraction/admin.py*)
   ````python
   '''
   Django FPGA Interaction demo application  - "admin.py"
   '''

   from django.contrib import admin
   from BoardInteraction.models import ADCSensorReading, ADCchannel, FPGAconfFiles

   # Allow access to all ADC data models and FPGA configuration files inside the SQLite Database
   admin.site.register(ADCchannel)
   admin.site.register(ADCSensorReading)
   admin.site.register(FPGAconfFiles) 

   # Personalisation of the admin page
   admin.site.site_header = 'rsYocto'                                         # Headline title           
   admin.site.index_title = 'Django FPGA interaction Demo Administration'     # Sub-Headline title       
   admin.site.site_title = 'rsYocto'                                          # HTML Headline
   ````
   
 ## Testing the Administrator page
 * Save all open files
 * To generate a SQLite database with these settings execude the following Linux Shell commands (*DjangoFPGA/*):
   ````bash
   python3 manage.py makemigrations
   python3 manage.py migrate
   python3 manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
   ````
 * Start the Django Server
   ````bash 
   python3 manage.py runserver 0:8181
   ```` 
 * Open the following URL with a web browser:
   ````txt
   http://<iPv4-Address of the Board>:8181/admin 
   ```` 
 * The Yocto Login Screen should appear:
   
  ![Alt text](pic/pic04.jpg?raw=true "Django Adim Login Screen")
 
 * Use your login credentials to login
 
  ![Alt text](pic/pic05.jpg?raw=true "Django Adim interface")
  
 * Here are all created databases accessible
 * At this point it is possible to add the sensor data manuelly 
 
 
 ## Presenting the Sensor Data and FPGA configuration on a web page
  * To view this data in a graphic the library [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) is used
    * That is an easy way to implement such kind of UI-elemets to a web page. 
    * In the same way it is possible to add any kind of diagramms to this web App (please follow the [official documentation](https://plot.ly/python/)
  * To display something on a web page it is necessary to add some lines of code to the "*views.py*"-file (*DjangoFPGA/AccSensor/views.py*):

    ````txt
    DjangoFPGA/BoardInteraction/templates/BoardInteraction/DisplayTemplate.html
    ````
    * Creat the file with all folders with *Visual Studio Code Insider*

* To show a File Upload box for the selecting of a FPGA configuration file these steps are requiered
 * Create inside the App the new file "*form.py*" (*DjangoFPGA/BoardInteraction/forms.py*)
 * Add the following code to this file

## Routing the URLs of the Application
* By default nothing will be routed to the front page of this application (http://<iPv4-Address of the Board>:8181/)
* To link the front page to the App, add the following lines of code to the global url configuration file (*DjangoFPGA/DjangoFPGA/urls.py*):
  ````python
  # DjangoFPGA URL Configuration
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path

  from BoardInteraction import views

  # URL linkages of this project 
  urlpatterns = [

  ````
  * Save all open files

 ## Testing the Web Application 
 * Now all configurations of the user elements are done and it is time to test this state
 * Import the Python pip-package "plotly" using for the plotting of the data:
   ````bash
   pip install plotly
   ````
 * Execude the following Linux Shell commands again (*DjangoFPGA/*):
   ````bash
   python3 manage.py makemigrations
   python3 manage.py migrate
   python3 manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
   ````
 * Start the Django Server
   ````bash 
   python3 manage.py runserver 0:8181
   ```` 
 * Open the following URL with a web browser:
   ````txt
   http://<iPv4-Address of the Board>:8181/admin 
   ```` 
 * The front page should now look like this: 
   
   ![Alt text](pic/pic08.jpg?raw=true "Django App ")

 * Test the Webinterface:
   * Change the FPGA configuration (the required type is described [here](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto/blob/rsYocto-1.03/doc/guides/6_newFPGAconf.md))
 * Turn the FPGA LED ON or OFF
 
At this point the ADC plot is empty, because no application has written to the database. This will be solved in the next steps.

# Reading of a Soft-IP ADC interface and writing the data into a SQLite datbase
As it is shwon in the sequence diagram above the readout of the FPGA data is triggered by calling the URL *http://127.0.1:8181/ADCtrigger*. Then the web interface starts an application to collect the ADC sensor data into the database. 

To implement that two extensions of the project are required: 
 1.	A function handler, that calls this application and writes the received values to the database 
   * Create a new python file called “services.py” (*DjangoFPGA/BoardInteraction/services.py*)
   * Add the following code to it:
      ````python
      '''
      Django FPGA Interaction demo application  - "sevices.py"

      # and write the value to a database
      #

          for sensor in ADCchannel.objects.all():   
              adc_u = 0
              # Start the Python Script "adcReadChannel.py" to read the ADC Channel
              try: 
                  adc_u = float(subprocess.check_output(['python3',settings.BASE_DIR+'/BoardInteraction/adcReadChannel.py',str(sensor.ch)],stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, timeout=None))
              except ValueError:
                  adc_u = 0
                  subprocess.call('echo Value Error ', shell=True)

              newreading.save()

              sensor.save()

          return True

  # Configuring the plotting of an ADC Channel
  This Django application needs a new database entry for all ADC Channels to read.
  This will be stored inside the database “ADCchannel“. This is only possible by hand as an Admin with the admin interface. 
 
 * Start the Django Server
   ````bash 
   python3 manage.py runserver 0:8181
   ```` 
  * Open the following URL with a web browser:
    ````txt
    http://<iPv4-Address of the Board>:8181/admin 
    ```` 
* On the Admin page select  **+**-Icon in the menu "Ad cchannels" 
* Inside the opend view press the "**ADD AD CCHANNEL**" Button

   ![Alt text](pic/pic06.jpg?raw=true "Django Adim interface - add Channel 1")
   
* Then insert the following to the web form to add a new Sensor to the ADC Channel
   * **Name**:   The name of the Sensor
   * **Slug**:   A unique ID for the Sensor 
   * **Reading**: The databebase with all sensor values
   * **CH**:      The choosed ADC Channel
 
 
 ![Alt text](pic/pic07.jpg?raw=true "Django Adim interface - add Channel 2")
 
 * Press save
 * **Note:** It is necessary to add one sensor value to the "readings" at least
   

 # Reading and plotting the data time triggered
 
* Open the Application with the following URL on a web browser:
   ````txt
   http://<iPv4-Address of the Board>:8181/ 
   ```` 
At this point only one ADC Value is inside the plot. To manually read the ADC channel it is possible to open
the following URL with a web browser:
   ````txt
   http://<iPv4-Address of the Board>:8181/ADCtrigger 
   ```` 
Then reload the application page. The new collected value is plotted now too. 

To automatically read the ADC Channel in a time interval are two approaches shown here
1.	**Usage of a shell script**
   * For example, run the following Linux shell script to read the ADC every 100 milliseconds for 500 times
      ````console 
      #!/bin/sh
      # Run script
      echo "*********************************"
      echo "read ADC Channel every 100ms "

      for nvar in {1..500}
      do
        curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8181/ADCtrigger

        sleep  0.1
      done 

      echo "*********************************"
      ````
2.	**Usage of the Linux task automation tool `crontab`**
   * This is on *rsYocto* pre-installed
   * A good documentation is available[here](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm)
   *  Open the "crontab" configuration file
      ```bash
      sudo nano /etc/crontab
      ````
   * Insert the following line to it
     ````console
      * * * * * root curl -s http:/127.0.0.1:8181/ADCtrigger
     ````
     * The Sensor will read this every minute
     * **Note:** To execute this change a restart of Linux is required  
  
* Refresh the management interface to recognize the time synced plotting of the ADC data
